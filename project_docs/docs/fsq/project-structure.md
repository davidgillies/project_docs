#Project Structure

This is a simple Django app.  The root conatins setup.py etc. that define the installation process.

**questionnaire/admin.py** provides the admin screen set up and adds in the import/export tools.

**questionnaire/models.py** provides the project models described in the intro.

**questionnaire/routers.py** provides routers for a database with the key 'db3' that you can set up in your Django project settings.py DATABASES dictionary as suggested in the INstallation section.

Other files are just standard Django place holders.
