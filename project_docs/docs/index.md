# Project Documentation

These docs cover the different parts of the project.

Docs have white boxes that denote code that can be run either at prompts or as scripts. 

It can be a pain to manage multiple virtualenvs but it is possible to set up desktops shortcuts to take the pain away! [Desktop Shortcuts](tips/shortcuts.md)
